                        Vietnamese cuisine features a combination of five fundamental tastes in the overall meal. <br/>
                        Each Vietnamese dish has a distinctive flavor which reflects one or more of these elements.<br/>
                        Traditional Vietnamese cooking is greatly admired for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of dairy and oil, complementary textures, and reliance on herbs and vegetables.<br/>
                        With the balance between fresh herbs and meats and a selective use of spices to reach a fine taste, Vietnamese food is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide.<br/></p>

                            Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. <br/>
                            Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country, Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates.<br/></p>
